| Details   The Wawalag sisters are ancestral creator beings in Aboriginal culture from Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. They are part of widespread sacred rituals and their story is associated with the Dreamtime, a period of time in Aboriginal belief where ancestral beings created the land and its social and linguistic structures. The sisters are believed to have played a role in drawing linguistic and social differences among the clans in Arnhem Land, while the ceremonies associated with their stories promote cultural unity. The story involves the sisters traveling to the Arafura Sea, the elder sister giving birth, and the Rainbow Serpent swallowing them and the baby. The narrative has been studied and represented through field research and Aboriginal artwork.
