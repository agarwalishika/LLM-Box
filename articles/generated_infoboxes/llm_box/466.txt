Catatonia is a complex neuropsychiatric behavioral syndrome characterized by abnormal movements, immobility, abnormal behaviors, and withdrawal. It is most often seen in mood disorders but can also be observed in other mental, neurological, and medical conditions. Catatonia is not a stand-alone diagnosis but rather a feature of the underlying disorder. There are several subtypes of catatonia, including akinetic catatonia, excited catatonia, malignant catatonia, and delirious mania. Failure to recognize and treat catatonia can lead to poor outcomes and potentially fatal consequences. Treatment options include benzodiazepines, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and NMDA receptor antagonists such as amantadine and memantine. Antipsychotics may be used cautiously due to the risk of worsening symptoms and serious adverse effects.
