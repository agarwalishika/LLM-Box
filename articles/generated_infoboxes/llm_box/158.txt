The '''John von Neumann Theory Prize''' is an annual award presented by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) to an individual or group who has made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences. The prize is named after mathematician John von Neumann and is awarded for a body of work rather than a single piece. It is intended to reflect contributions that have stood the test of time and the criteria for selection include significance, innovation, depth, and scientific excellence. The prize includes a cash award of  5,000, a medallion, and a citation.
