| Details   The roc is an enormous legendary bird of prey in the popular mythology of the Middle East. It is often depicted as a giant eagle-like creature with immense strength and the ability to carry off large animals, including elephants. The roc is featured in various Arabian fairy tales and sailors' folklore, including the tales "Abd al-Rahman the Maghribi's Story of the Rukh" and "Sinbad the Sailor" from One Thousand and One Nights. The concept of the roc is believed to have originated from the Indian solar bird Garuda and the chthonic serpent N ga. The roc is known for its association with great size and power, and its ability to fly vast distances.}}
