| Details   The unicorn is a legendary creature described as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. It is commonly depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In European literature and art, the unicorn has been a symbol of purity and grace. It was believed that only a virgin could capture a unicorn. The horn of the unicorn was believed to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. The narwhal tusk was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn in medieval and Renaissance times. The unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture as a symbol of fantasy or rarity.
