The '''International Dublin Literary Award''' (Irish: Duais Liteartha Idirn isi nta Bhaile  tha Chliath), established as the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 1996, is presented each year for a novel written or translated into English. It promotes excellence in world literature and is solely sponsored by Dublin City Council, Ireland. At  100,000, the award is one of the richest literary prizes in the world. If the winning book is a translation (as it has been nine times), the prize is divided between the writer and the translator, with the writer receiving  75,000 and the translator  25,000. The first award was made in 1996 to David Malouf for his English-language novel ''Remembering Babylon''. Nominations are submitted by public libraries worldwide   over 400 library systems in 177 countries worldwide are invited to nominate books each year   from which the shortlist and the eventual winner are selected by an international panel of judges (which changes each year).

   Eligibility and procedure   
The prize is open to novels written in any language and by authors of any nationality, provided the work has been published in English or English translation. The presentation of the award is post-dated by two years from the date of publication. Thus, to win an award in 2017, the work must have been published in 2015. If it is an English translation, the work must have been published in its original language between two and six years before its translation. The scope for inclusion has been subject to criticism; according to ''The Irish Times'' journalist Eileen Battersby, "many of the titles are already well known even at the time of the publication of the long list." Dublin City Public Libraries seek nominations from 400 public libraries from major cities across the world. Libraries can apply to be considered for inclusion in the nomination process. The longlist is announced in October or November of each year, and the shortlist (up to 10 titles) is announced in March or April.
