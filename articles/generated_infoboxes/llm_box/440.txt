'''Day of the Daleks''' is the first serial of the ninth season of the British science fiction television series ''Doctor Who'', which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 1 to 22 January 1972. It was the first of four Third Doctor serials to feature the Daleks, which returned to the series for the first time since ''The Evil of the Daleks'' (1967).

   Plot   
A British diplomat, Sir Reginald Styles, is organising a peace conference to avert World War III. 
In his study at Auderly House he is held at gunpoint by a soldier wielding a futuristic looking pistol, who then mysteriously vanishes. The shaken Styles believes that he has been visited by a ghost. The Third Doctor, Jo and the Brigadier go to Auderly House to investigate the mystery. The Doctor discovers a crude time machine and an ultrasonic disintegrator gun. He and Jo spend the night at Auderly House to monitor any activity.
The machine turns out to be from the 22nd Century. As the Doctor tries to reactivate the time machine, three rebel fighters   Anat, Boaz, and Shura   appear from the time vortex on a mission to assassinate Styles. It transpires that the rebels come from an alternate future in which a war-ravaged Earth has been enslaved by the Daleks. The outbreak of world war has been attributed to an explosion at the 20th-century peace conference, and the rebels believe that by assassinating Styles, they can alter future events and prevent the Dalek invasion from ever taking place. The Doctor surmises that the rebel attack itself will be the cause of the explosion, and that the rebels are caught up in a time paradox.
The time machine contains a homing device which alerts the Daleks to the Doctor's location. They launch an attack, and the ensuing battle shifts back and forth between the 20th and 22nd Centuries. The Doctor and Jo discover a future version of Styles, who is being manipulated by the Daleks. They manage to prevent the assassination and return the rebels to their own time. The Doctor then deactivates the time machine, ensuring that the events leading to the Dalek invasion will not occur.

   Production   
''Day of the Daleks'' was commissioned as part of the ninth season of ''Doctor Who''. It was written by Louis Marks and directed by Paul Bernard. The serial marked the return of the Daleks to the series after a five-year absence. The Dalek props used in the serial were the same ones that had been used in the 1960s. Due to budget constraints, the Dalek voices were provided by the same operators who controlled the props. The serial was filmed at BBC Television Centre and on location at Dropmore Park in Buckinghamshire.

   Reception   
''Day of the Daleks'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The serial's complex time travel plot and the return of the Daleks were praised. However, some critics felt that the story was overly convoluted and that the Daleks were underutilized. The serial's ratings were also lower than expected, possibly due to competition from the popular game show ''The Generation Game''.
