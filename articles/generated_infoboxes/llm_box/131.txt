| Details   The European dragon is a legendary creature in folklore and mythology among the overlapping cultures of Europe. It is typically depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, lizard-like creature with leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long, muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with additional features such as feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, ivory spikes, and various exotic decorations. In Christian culture, dragons are often associated with guarding treasure-filled caverns or castles. They are commonly portrayed as adversaries to heroes, with evil dragons being slain by the hero and good dragons providing support or wise advice. The dragon is often found in its underground lair, symbolizing its ancient connection to the earth.
