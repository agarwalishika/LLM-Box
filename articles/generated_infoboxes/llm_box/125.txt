| Details   The Ceryneian hind was an enormous female deer in Greek mythology. It had golden antlers like a stag, hooves of bronze or brass, and a dappled hide. Known for its exceptional swiftness, the hind snorted fire. It was the third labor of Heracles to capture the hind alive and bring it to Eurystheus in Mycenae. The hind was sacred to Artemis and was often found in the vicinity of the river Cerynites. Heracles pursued the hind for over a year, finally capturing it near the river Ladon. The hind was later presented to Artemis as a propitiation.}}
