| Details   A human capable of transforming into a wolf or wolf-like creature, typically during a full moon, due to a curse or affliction. Belief in werewolves emerged during the medieval period and spread to the New World with colonialism. Persecution of werewolves was part of the witch-hunt phenomenon, although less common. Accusations of lycanthropy were often mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. Notable cases include Peter Stumpp in 1589. The belief in werewolves has persisted in folklore and popular culture.
