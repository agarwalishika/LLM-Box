The Satyr, also known as Silenus, Silenos, or Selini, is a male nature spirit in Greek mythology. They are depicted with ears and a tail resembling those of a horse, as well as a permanent, exaggerated erection. Early artistic representations sometimes include horse-like legs, but by the sixth century BC, they were more often represented with human legs. Satyrs are comically hideous, with mane-like hair, bestial faces, snub noses, and are always shown naked. They are characterized by their ribaldry and are known as lovers of wine, music, dancing, and women. Satyrs were companions of the god Dionysus and were believed to inhabit remote locales such as woodlands, mountains, and pastures. They often attempted to seduce or rape nymphs and mortal women, usually with little success. Satyrs are sometimes depicted masturbating or engaging in bestiality.

In classical Athens, satyrs made up the chorus in a genre of play known as a "satyr play," which was a parody of tragedy and known for its bawdy and obscene humor. The only complete surviving play of this genre is Cyclops by Euripides, although a significant portion of Sophocles's Ichneutae has also survived. In mythology, the satyr Marsyas is said to have challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest and was flayed alive for his hubris. Although superficially ridiculous, satyrs were also thought to possess useful knowledge if they could be coaxed into revealing it. The satyr Silenus was the tutor of the young Dionysus, and a story from Ionia tells of a silenos who gave sound advice when captured.

Over the course of Greek history, satyrs gradually became portrayed as more human and less bestial. They also began to acquire goat-like characteristics in some depictions as a result of conflation with the Pans, plural forms of the god Pan with the legs and horns of goats. The Romans identified satyrs with their native nature spirits known as fauns.
