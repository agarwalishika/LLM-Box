| Details   The Lake Tianchi Monster, also known as the Heaven Lake Monster or Cheonji Monster, is a legendary creature said to inhabit Heaven Lake, located in the peak of Baekdu Mountain within the Baekdu-daegan and Changbai mountain ranges. It is described as having a human-like head attached to a 1.5-meter (5 ft) neck, with a white ring around the bottom of its neck and grey, smooth skin. Sightings of the creature have been reported since 1903, with the most recent sighting in 2007. However, skeptics argue that the existence of such a creature is unlikely due to the lake's history of volcanic activity.
