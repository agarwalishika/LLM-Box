Corum Jhaelen Irsei is a fictional character and the protagonist of the "Corum Chronicles trilogy" and "Silver Hand trilogy" written by Michael Moorcock. He first appeared in the novel The Knight of Swords in 1971. Corum is known by various titles, including "the Prince in the Scarlet Robe" and "Corum of the Silver Hand". He is a human hero who loses his left hand and right eye early in his first story, which are later replaced by the Eye of Rhynn and the six-fingered Hand of Kwll, respectively. These artifacts grant him powerful abilities but conflict with his personal morality. Corum is often seen wearing an eye patch to control the overwhelming effects of the Eye of Rhynn. After losing both artifacts, he relies on a normal eyepatch and a silver prosthetic hand. 

Corum is part of Michael Moorcock's "Eternal Champion" concept, a recurring character who is reborn across different universes to maintain the balance between Chaos and Law. While other aspects of the Eternal Champion, such as Elric of Melniboné, follow Chaos, Corum aligns himself with Law and opposes the plans of Arioch, a chaos god. Throughout his adventures, Corum encounters other incarnations of the Eternal Champion.
