The Sphinx is a mythical creature with the head of a human, the body of a lion, and the wings of an eagle. It is known for its appearance in Greek and Egyptian mythology. In Greek tradition, the Sphinx is depicted as a treacherous and merciless being with the head of a woman, the haunches of a lion, and the wings of a bird. In Egyptian mythology, the Sphinx is typically depicted as a man and seen as benevolent. Both versions of the Sphinx are considered guardians and often flank the entrances to temples. The Sphinx is commonly associated with grand architectural structures, such as royal tombs or religious temples. The word "sphinx" comes from the Greek      , associated with the verb       , meaning "to squeeze" or "to tighten up".
