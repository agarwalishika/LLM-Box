Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey is the fictional protagonist in the Lord Peter Wimsey series by Dorothy L. Sayers. He first appeared in the novel "Whose Body?" in 1923 and his last major appearance was in "Busman's Honeymoon" in 1937. Lord Peter Wimsey is a British gentleman detective known for solving mysteries for his own amusement. He is often assisted by his valet and former batman, Mervyn Bunter, his good friend and later brother-in-law, police detective Charles Parker, and occasionally by his wife, Harriet Vane. Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. He is known for his intelligence, athletic ability, and expertise in criminology, food, fashion, and classical music. Lord Peter Wimsey is also an avid collector of incunabula and enjoys driving fast cars, particularly his powerful Daimler.
