| Design   A horizontal tricolour of red, green, and blue, with a black isosceles triangle on the hoist side. The green band splits into a horizontal "Y" shape, with the arms ending at the corners of the hoist side. The arms are separated by narrow yellow or gold bands. The red and blue bands are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes. The stripes at the fly end are in the 5:1:3:1:5 ratio.
