'''Spain in Flames''' is a 1937 compilation film made by Helen van Dongen during the Spanish Civil War. The film consists of two parts. The first, "The Fight for Freedom", was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary ''Spain and the Fight for Freedom''. The second part, "They Shalt Not Pass", was based on a short film ''No Pasaran!'' done by the Artkino Film Company of the Soviet Union. John Dos Passos narrated parts of the film, and the commentary was written by Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Archibald MacLeish, and Prudencio de Pareda. The film's sympathies are firmly with the Loyalists.
