(1) Is all the information in the infobox accurate to the information in the article? Please identify any potential discrepancies.
yes.

(2) On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is too verbose and 10 is too concise, please rate the field values on their succinctness.
7 - rather than saying "various countries" should actually list the countries 

(3) Please list any additional fields you would have added to the infobox to make it a more holistic summary of the article, if any
size, description.
Note: I like the summary that is at the bottom of the infobox that includes the origin103 llm_box
