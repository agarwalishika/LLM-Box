(1) Is all the information in the infobox accurate to the information in the article? Please identify any potential discrepancies.
Yes accurate

(2) On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is too verbose and 10 is too concise, please rate the field values on their succinctness.
7
The fields are not concise- the keys of the infobox are not key names, but instead they are just repeats of the field values.
Also, I would have broken up the name and the title into multiple fields. name = Banquo, title = Thane of Lochaber.
"In universe information" is also not a descriptive field
It is unclear what the Theodore riau field is about.

(3) Please list any additional fields you would have added to the infobox to make it a more holistic summary of the article, if any
I would rename the "affiliation" field to the book title
I would add more information about quotes
I would add more information about the background of the character
I would add notable quotes
I would add act/chapter appearances
